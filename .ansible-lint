# ansible.builtin.tempfile is fucking useless. don't even bring it up.
#   all it does is fucking wrap mktemp and add FUCKING NOTHING OF VALUE.
#
# it won't even clean up the temp file after the playbook run is done.
# see: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/25145
#
# there is literally nothing of value with it. it's just one more thing
#   that could randomly break underneath you because some fuckwit of a
#   glorified-webdesigner-turned-devderps-engineer decided that the current
#   methodology isn't "fashionable" anymore and needs to arbitrarily change.

# note for above: ignoring the warning at the site is preferable due to other warnings that may occur

#
# fuck you, ansible-lint.
#
# you do not just get to make "local_action" a linter warning and say
#   "it's deprecated".
#
# this rule is not something that anyone with more than three fucking
#   braincells should consider valid. either the ansible project itself
#   declares it deprecated, or it isn't deprecated at all.
#

#
# all ansible-lint says is "don't use it". there is no documentation as
#   to *why*. it's just "deprecated", except it fucking isn't!
#
# https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_delegation.html#delegating-tasks
#
# additionally, the *ANSIBLE* documentation states that it is a
#   "a shorthand syntax that you can use on a per-task basis"
#
# that doesn't sound to me like it it's deprecated.
# that sounds to me like some arrogant fuckwit mouth-breather decided
#   to bikeshed. because it doesn't. look. pretty.
#
# it's not like its purpose could be easily mistaken either.
#   "local_action" directly implies that it will happen LOCALLY.
# "delegate_to: 127.0.0.1" implies the same thing, except in
#   an (apparently) more-desired obtuse fashion.
#
# so fuck you, ansible-lint.

# One-off handlers result in worse code in the end, quite frankly.
#
# Separating pieces and making the flow of execution harder to follow is a significant antipattern.
#   If they were reused heavily, sure, great, do that. But if it's only being used once,
#   it's just another action.  Seriously, it seems that the concept of "nuance" is lost on
#   the maintainers ansible-lint.
