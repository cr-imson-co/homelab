# ansible.builtin.tempfile is fucking useless. don't even bring it up.
#   all it does is fucking wrap mktemp and add FUCKING NOTHING OF VALUE.
#
# it won't even clean up the temp file after the playbook run is done.
# see: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/25145
#
# there is literally nothing of value with it. it's just one more thing
#   that could randomly break underneath you because some fuckwit of a
#   glorified-webdesigner-turned-devderps-engineer decided that the current
#   methodology isn't "fashionable" anymore and needs to arbitrarily change.

# One-off handlers result in worse code in the end, quite frankly.
#
# Separating pieces and making the flow of execution harder to follow is a significant antipattern.
#   If they were reused heavily, sure, great, do that. But if it's only being used once,
#   it's just another action.  Seriously, it seems that the concept of "nuance" is lost on
#   the maintainers ansible-lint.
